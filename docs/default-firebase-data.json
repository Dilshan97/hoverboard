We’ve implemented a gRPC server that allows you to play Simon with other players over the internet!\n\nIn this workshop we will dive into the toolset and libraries to build your very own Simon Says client for this server. We will have a message description in Protocol Buffers format and some stub code in several languages ready for you to play with. The goal for this workshop is for you to have a working client that you can use to play (and beat!) other attendees of the workshop.",

And when should or could I synchronize data?\n\nAndroid offers a powerful—and underrated—account manager. Let's explore the possibilities together and lay out an architecture for engineering an Android app based on accounts.",
